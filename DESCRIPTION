Description: This package uses the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) or the Particle Filter to assimilate observations and generate forecasts of lake water quality using the General Lake Model - Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics.  The package includes functions to generate the weather and inflow forcing files, organize observations in the form required by the data assimilation, and visualize output.
