\description{
Run ensemble data assimilation and/or produce forecasts
}
\details{
Uses the ensemble data assimilation to predict water quality for a lake
or reservoir.  The function requires the initial conditions (\code{states_init}) for each
state and ensemble member using an array with the following dimension order:
states, depth, ensembles member.  If you are fitting parameters, it also requires
initial conditions for each parameter and ensemble member using an array (\code{par_init}) with the
following dimension order: parameters, ensemble member.  The arrays for states_init
and pars_init can be created using the \code{generate_initial_conditions()} function, if
starting from initial conditions in the  \code{states_config} data frame or from observations
in first time column of the \code{obs} array.
